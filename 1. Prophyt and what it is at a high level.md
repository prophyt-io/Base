# Description
PROPHYT (Portfolio Optimization for High-Yield Trading) is a finance intelligence SAAS platform. Real-time trading signals from TradingView webhooks, processed through n8n/Next.js, stored in PostgreSQL, and visualized in a Next.js dashboard.

**Parent project** for all PROPHYT development phases:
- [[Phase 1 - n8n MVP]]: Build basic webhook processing in n8n
- [[Phase 2 - Python Backend]]: Migrate to Python backend for speed
- [[Phase 3 - Frontend]]: Build real-time dashboard

Hosted on [[1. Steamdeck Local Server]] infrastructure.
and using the [[Data Processing & Database Strategy]] as a guide for how we will continue to incorporate changes

# Notes

## Project Overview

### Vision
Real-time trading signal aggregation and analysis platform for retail traders. Process multiple indicator types (VWAP, Chaikin Money Flow, Lux Algo, Harmonics, Options Sweeps, PolyMarket) and present actionable insights.

### Team Vision
Empower traders and investors with high efficacy DCA based execution ladders along with actionable insights they can trust.

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: n8n (Phase 1) → Python Backend (Phase 2)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSONB
- **Queue**: Redis
- **Frontend**: Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- **Infrastructure**: Docker on Steam Deck

### Key Features
* ***Proprietary Premium Signals**: - Real-time webhook ingestion from trading view from Tuned TradingView Strategy's with Buy, stoploss, and price targets
*  ***Proprietary Execution Ladder**: LadderScale — AI-recommended adjustable inverse-weighted DCA with tunable alpha (aggressiveness), Fibonacci retracement targeting (38.2%–61.8%), dynamic 3σ volatility-based bottom, and perfect limit-order execution using our propreitary harmonic tuning. 
* *  ***Proprietary Valuation Model**: realtime Price Grading using Dynamically adjusting VWAP relative to Options expiry dates. Allowing for proper relative understanding of price Time and opportunity.
* ***Stock Dashboard**: Track real-time stock prices with interactive line and candlestick charts, including historical data, and 
* ***Powerful Search**: Quickly find the best stocks with an intelligent search system that helps you navigate through and filter stocks by industry, performance, or market cap. ETC ETC
* ***Company Insights**: Explore detailed financial data such as PE ratio, EPS, revenue, recent news, filings, analyst ratings, and sentiment scores for informed decision-making.
* ***AI-Powered Alerts & Summaries**: Generate personalized market summaries, daily digests, and earnings report notifications, helping users track performance and make data-driven decisions.
